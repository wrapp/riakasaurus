Riakasaurus is based on the txriak project

This module is an almost complete copy of the original riak.py provided
in Basho's standard Riak distribution. Only functional change is to use
Twisted deferreds when communicating with Riak via http and to use
Twisted logging.

Original riak.py was Apache License 2.0. That license is maintained for
the riakasaurus module.
